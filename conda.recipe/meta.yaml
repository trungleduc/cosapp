  summary: "CoSApp, the Collaborative System Approach."
  description: |
    The primary goal of **CoSApp** is to help technical department in the design of complex systems.
    To do so, the framework allows the simulation of various systems representing the different
    parts of the final product in a common environment. The consequences are the ability for each
    subsystem team to carry out design study with a direct feedback of the impact of parameters at
    the product level.

    The main features are :

    - Butterfly effect

    Coupled your preferred simulation software with CoSApp to get immediate impact on main product
    variables and iterates to converge on a better design.

    - Design guidance

    All systems can share design parameters associated with an acceptable range. You can take advantage
    of those limited degrees of freedom without fear of breaking your neighbors' work.

    - Margins & Uncertainties

    All design parameters have an intrinsic dispersion. Knowing the range of fluctuations is crucial to
    ensure the robustness of the design. CoSApp handles natively uncertain variables.
