    "\n",
    "Typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An *inward* is an input parameter needed by the system to compute its output. For example, the pressure losses coefficient of a duct is an inward, used to compute the output flow port from its input flow port.\n",
    "- An *outward* is an output variable deduced from inputs, such as an intermediate variable of a computation, which is exposed to other systems. For instance, the difference between the input and output pressures in a duct system is a local variable, which may be of interest to neighbouring systems. Another example is the table object read from a filename (the filename being usually an *inward*). \n",
    "\n",
    "An inward `x` (resp. outward) defined in system `s` can be accessed as either `s.x` or `s.inwards.x` (resp. `s.outwards.x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables in **CoSApp** accept additional information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **unit**: Physical unit of the variable, given by a string. **CoSApp** will take care of unit conversion between connected systems. However, *units are not enforced* inside a `System`. Therefore, module developers must ensure that all variables are consistently converted in method `compute`.\n",
    "- **desc**: Short description of the variable.\n",
    "- **dtype**: If you need to force certain data type(s) on a variable, a tuple of acceptable types can be provided through this keyword. If that information is not supplied, dtype is inferred from the variable value; *e.g.* a number (`int` or `float`) will be typed as `Number`.\n",

    "However, the connector direction, that is the direction of information flow between the two connected entities, depends on the direction of the pulled port:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the pulled port/variable is an *input*, then the connector will transfer data **downwards**, *i.e.* it will copy the parent value down to the connected child value.\n",
    "- If the pulled port/variable is an *output*, the flow is reversed, *i.e.* the connector will transfer the child value up to the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has a strong implication on **pulled input variables**, which should always be **specified at parent level**.\n",
    "If you set the child input directly, its value will be superseded by the parent value before the child system is computed, and the system will not behave as expected:"
