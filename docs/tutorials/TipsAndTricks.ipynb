    "## Synchronize sub-system inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs/inwards of a system specify the necessary information for local execution of the system.\n",

    "When gathered in a higher-level system `Airplane` as `left_wing` and `right_wing`, it may be desirable to force both wings to have the same length, by construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such input synchronization is natively handled by CoSApp through the pulling mechanism:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Airplane(System):\n",
    "    def setup(self):\n",
    "        self.add_child(PlaneWing('left_wing', pulling={'length': 'wing_length'}))\n",
    "        self.add_child(PlaneWing('right_wing', pulling={'length': 'wing_length'}))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explaination:\n",
    "Pulling an input/inward creates a parent-to-child *downward* connector.\n",
    "Thus, the first `add_child` statement will create new inward `wing_length` on the fly, as well as a connector `wing_length -> left_wing.length`.\n",
    "When the right wing sub-system is created, a second connector `wing_length -> right_wing.length` is generated, using existing inward `wing_length`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plane = Airplane('plane')\n",
    "\n",
    "plane.wing_length = 12.3\n",
    "plane.run_once()  # will propagate `wing_length` to both wings\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "* Connectors only transfer information when `run_once()` or `run_drivers()` is invoked.\n",
    "* Any value directly assigned to `plane.left_wing.length`, say, will be eventually superseded by `plane.wing_length` at each model execution.\n",
    "* Renaming pulled inputs/inwards at parent level is not mandatory. Passing a list of attribute names rather than a dictionary as `pulling` argument will trigger the same mechanisms, with no name changes. In the example above, it is just more explicit to expose inward `wing_length` rather than just `length` in the context of the airplane."
