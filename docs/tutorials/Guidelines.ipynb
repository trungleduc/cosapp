    "### \"Why should I bother writing tests?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing tests is often perceived as extra work producing trivial code, and as a loss of valuable time (after all, the code is already written!).\n",
    "Strictly speaking, yes, writing test is extra work. But you should view tests as an investment on future maintainance time, and a great added value to the delivered code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, come to think about it, *everyone tests their code*, one way or another. Most of the time, though, codes are tested interactively, by printing out data, or plotting numerical results.\n",
    "Writing tests is just a smart way to capitalize all the time you have spent checking the validity of your work, into dedicated code, *delivered with your code*.\n",
    "Moreover, using a dedicated framework, such as `GoogleTest` for C++ or `pytest` for Python, ensures that your test functions can be run automatically by servers *every time the code is modified*, or new code is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tests are an integral part of your code**; they must be delivered with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tests must be runnable in batch mode** one way or another. Using a dedicated framework garanties they will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tests are an insurance policy**. The code may be modified, as long as all tests pass. Note that this implies a reasonnably high test coverage (the extent of expected behaviour effectively tested).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tests greatly increase the value of your work**. If you write prototype code for somebody else to port into a faster or more industrial code, a good test basis is priceless. If you write production code, tests are mandatory for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tests can be used as documentation**, as they contain elementary snippets of code usage, and their expected behaviour and/or result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Ideally, tests shoud be written *before* the code**. Think of it as a contract: the expected behaviour is laid down as requirements, to be later addressed by the code itself. This methodology (often referred to as TDD, for *Test Driven Development*), ensures the code is the minimal necessary implementation satisfying given requirements.\n"

    "### Pytest (for Python code)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a standard testing package called `unittest`.\n",
    "While this package works perfectly, its syntax is widely acknowledged as tedious, and not always easily readable. More importantly, the root cause of test failures returned by `unittest` can be sometimes hard to understand, which somehow defeats the purpose of a test basis.\n",

    "We recommend instead the package `pytest` (https://pytest.org), which presents the great advantage to capture natural Python assertions (through the use of plain `assert` statements, as in the example above), and turn assertion failures into meaningful, informative messages. Cherry on the cake, `pytest` handles tests written with the `unittest` syntax, so legacy `unittest` tests do not need to be rewritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytest primarily works as a console application. When executed in the top directory of your code, it will automatically search for all files with a specific name pattern (by default, test\\*.py and Test\\*.py), and execute all functions with a similar pattern within these files. A common convention, to test a specific class `MyClass`, is to create a file `test_MyClass.py` in a subdirectory `tests`. This file will typically contain test functions of the kind `test_MyClass_foobar()`, testing method `foobar` of `MyClass`.\n",

    "### Long line of inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "While inheritance is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (for abstraction, typically), it is important to realize that it also represents the strongest coupling level between classes. As such, it should be used with care *for concrete classes* (no restriction applies to abstract interfaces), as it tightly binds a class to its base class. In other words, everything that applies to the mother class applies to all the daughter classes, which may at some point become an inconvenience.\n",
    "It particular, this may lead to burdening the mother class with things that are necessary to only a portion of the daughter classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, things get worse as the line of inheritance grows longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to inheritance can be **class composition**, that is the use of a specific class as a member of a new class, rather than making the new class inherit from the first one.\n",
    "Here, the general rule-of-thumb is again a clear and limited scope of each class.\n",
